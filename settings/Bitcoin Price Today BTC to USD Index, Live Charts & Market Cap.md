## Why Bitcoin Matters in 2025

### Investment Considerations  

While BTC presents opportunities for portfolio diversification, its **high volatility** demands caution. Sudden price swingsâ€”often driven by macroeconomic trends or regulatory newsâ€”require thorough risk assessment. Always conduct independent research before investing.
