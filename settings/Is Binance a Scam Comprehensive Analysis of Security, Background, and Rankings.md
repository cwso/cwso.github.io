## Binance Security: Robust Protections Against Threats

### Cold Wallet Storage and SAFU Fund

Binance implements advanced security measures to protect user assets. Approximately 90% of user funds are stored in offline cold wallets, significantly reducing exposure to potential cyber threats. Additionally, the **SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users)** was established in 2018, allocating 10% of trading fees to create a $1 billion+ insurance pool. This fund successfully covered a $40 million loss during a 2019 hack, demonstrating Binance's commitment to user protection.

### Real-Time Risk Monitoring

The platform employs 24/7 surveillance systems that automatically detect suspicious activities. Any abnormal transactions trigger a 24-48 hour withdrawal suspension period, allowing security teams to investigate potential threats. This proactive approach has prevented multiple potential breaches since the system's implementation.
