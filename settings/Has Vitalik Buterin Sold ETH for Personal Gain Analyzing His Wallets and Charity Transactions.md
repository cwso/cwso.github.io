## Vitalik Buterin's Statement on ETH Sales  

In a social media post, Buterin clarified:  
> "If you see an article claiming I sent X ETH to an exchange, itâ€™s likely tied to donations. Since 2018, Iâ€™ve sold ETH only for charitable purposes."  

This statement addresses recurring speculation about his financial motives. Buterin emphasized that recipients of his donations, such as nonprofits, may liquidate ETH to cover operational costs. However, he did not specify which organizations were involved.  

### Why This Matters for Crypto Markets  
Vitalikâ€™s wallet activity often triggers price volatility. For instance, a 2022 transfer of 10,000 ETH to Coinbase briefly spooked investors, causing a 5% dip in ETHâ€™s value. Such reactions highlight the marketâ€™s sensitivity to perceived "whale" movements.
