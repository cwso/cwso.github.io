Cryptocurrency users often need to move digital assets between wallets and exchanges for trading, investment, or storage purposes.

## Understanding imToken and OKX  

Before initiating a transfer, itâ€™s essential to understand the roles of these platforms:  
- **imToken**: A decentralized wallet supporting Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and other blockchain networks. Users retain full control over private keys.  
- **OKX**: A centralized exchange enabling trading, staking, and storage of digital assets. Funds deposited here can be traded or held under the platformâ€™s custody.  

This process involves sending assets from imTokenâ€™s self-managed environment to OKXâ€™s custodial wallet system.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Transfer Funds  

### Step 1: Check Your imToken Balance  
Ensure your imToken wallet contains sufficient digital assets for the transfer. Navigate to the **"Assets"** tab in the imToken app to verify balances for Ethereum, Bitcoin, or other supported cryptocurrencies.  

> **Pro Tip**: Always leave a small reserve in your wallet to cover future network fees.  

### Step 2: Locate OKX Deposit Address  
1. Log in to your OKX account.  
2. Go to **"Funds" > "Deposit"** and select the cryptocurrency you want to transfer (e.g., ETH, BTC).  
3. Choose the correct blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum for ETH, Bitcoin for BTC).  
4. Copy the deposit address provided by OKX.  

**Critical**: Use the exact network specified by OKX. Sending assets via the wrong network may result in permanent loss.  

### Step 3: Initiate Transfer from imToken  
1. Open the imToken app and select the cryptocurrency to send.  
2. Tap **"Send"** and paste the OKX deposit address into the recipient field.  
3. Enter the amount to transfer. Ensure it doesnâ€™t exceed your available balance (including network fees).  
4. Double-check the address and transaction details.  

### Step 4: Confirm and Monitor  
1. Confirm the transaction in imToken and pay the network fee (gas).  
2. Track the transaction status on OKX under **"Funds" > "Transaction History"**.  
3. Wait for the required blockchain confirmations (typically 12â€“30 minutes for Ethereum, faster for Bitcoin).
