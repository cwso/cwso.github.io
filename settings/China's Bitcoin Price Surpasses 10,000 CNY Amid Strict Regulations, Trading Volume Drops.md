## Trading Volume Decline: A New Market Reality  
While prices reached historic levels, trading activity in China remains subdued. Over the past week, domestic exchanges accounted for just 10.5% of global Bitcoin trading volume. Huobi Global's daily Bitcoin transactions dropped to 13,000 BTCâ€”40% lower than peak volumes and a mere 0.3% of January 5's record high.  

### Structural Market Changes  
1. **Price Disparity**: Domestic Bitcoin trades at 2,417 CNY below overseas prices, creating arbitrage incentives.  
2. **Global Ranking Drop**: China fell from the top trading position to third place, trailing USD and JPY transactions.
