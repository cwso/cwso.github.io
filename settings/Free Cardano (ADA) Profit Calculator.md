## Calculating Crypto Taxes: A Step-by-Step Guide  

### Understanding Taxable Events  
In the U.S., crypto is subject to **income tax** (e.g., staking rewards) and **capital gains tax** (e.g., sales).  

#### Formula:  
**Gain/Loss = Proceeds – Cost Basis**  
- **Proceeds**: Disposal value (e.g., $52,000 sale).  
- **Cost Basis**: Acquisition value + fees (e.g., $50,000 + $10 fee).  

### Example Calculation  
- Sale Proceeds: $52,000  
- Cost Basis: $50,000 + $10 (buy fee) = $50,010  
- **Net Gain**: $1,990  

### FAQ: How Do I Report Staking Income?  
A: Staking rewards are taxed as ordinary income at their fair market value on the date received.  

## Should You Reinvest Crypto Profits?  

Reinvesting profits can amplify returns but carries risks. Consider:  

1. **Market Volatility**: ADA prices can fluctuate rapidly.  
2. **Tax Obligations**: Selling crypto triggers capital gains taxes. Ensure you have liquidity to cover tax bills.  
3. **Diversification**: Allocate gains across less volatile assets (e.g., real estate) to mitigate risk.  

### Expert Tip:  
“Reinvest only what you’re prepared to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable.” – Financial Advisor, 2024  

## Determining the Optimal Profit-Taking Percentage  

There’s no universal percentage, but benchmarks exist:  

- **S&P 500 Benchmark**: Historical 11.88% annual return (1957–2021).  
- **Crypto Volatility**: Aims above 20% may justify higher risk.  

### Risk vs. Reward Table  

| Risk Level | Target ROI | Potential Drawbacks       |  
|------------|------------|---------------------------|  
| Low        | 10–15%     | Misses crypto’s upside    |  
| Medium     | 20–50%     | Moderate market exposure  |  
| High       | >50%       | High volatility, crashes  |  

### FAQ: When Should I Sell ADA?  
A: Use trailing stop-loss orders or consult a financial advisor to align with your risk tolerance.
