## Understanding the 5-Day Moving Average  

A **moving average** smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price over a specified period. The 5-day moving average calculates the average closing price of an asset over the past five days, helping traders filter out short-term volatility and focus on the underlying trend.  

### Why Use the 5-Day MA?  
- **Short-Term Trend Identification**: Ideal for day traders and swing traders.  
- **Dynamic Support/Resistance Levels**: Prices often react to the 5-day MA line.  
- **Signal for Momentum**: Crossovers with other MAs (e.g., 10-day) can indicate trend changes.
