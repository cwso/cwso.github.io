## BITFRONT vs. BITBOX: Evolution of LINE's Crypto Strategy

|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| Trading Type           | Crypto-to-crypto only     | Fiat & crypto trading           |  
| Jurisdiction           | Singapore                 | United States                   |  
| Language Support       | Limited                   | 15 languages                    |
