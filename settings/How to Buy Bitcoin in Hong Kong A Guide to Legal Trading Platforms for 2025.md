## Understanding Bitcoin

**Bitcoin (BTC)** represents a revolutionary financial system operating without central authorities. Key characteristics include:

   Operates through peer-to-peer blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries like banks or governments. Transactions occur directly between users globally.

2. **Scarcity Principle**  
   With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin's scarcity parallels precious metals, potentially driving long-term value appreciation.

3. **Global Utility**  
   Accepted by over 15,000 merchants worldwide for online purchases, remittances, and investments. Stored securely in digital wallets using private keys.

4. **Blockchain Security**  
   All transactions are cryptographically secured across distributed nodes, ensuring immutability and fraud resistance while maintaining user anonymity.
