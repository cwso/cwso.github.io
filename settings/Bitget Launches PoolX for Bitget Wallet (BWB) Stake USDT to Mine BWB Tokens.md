## How the PoolX Staking Works  

### Mining Pool Details  
| **Pool Asset** | **Reward Allocation** | **Maximum Cap** |  
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|  
| USDT           | 2,000,000 BWB         | 300,000 USDT    |  

Users contribute USDT to the pool, and rewards are distributed hourly based on their proportional share of the total staked amount.  

### Reward Calculation Formula  
The formula ensures fair distribution:  
**User Reward = (Userâ€™s Staked USDT Ã· Total USDT in Pool) Ã— 2,000,000 BWB**  

For example:  
- If you stake 30,000 USDT (10% of the 300,000 USDT cap), youâ€™ll earn 10% of the 2,000,000 BWB reward pool.  

### Event Timeline  
**Staking Period:** June 6, 16:00 â€“ June 21, 16:00 (UTC+8)
