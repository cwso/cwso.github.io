### Step 4: Initiate the Withdrawal

1. Navigate to the **Withdrawal Section**.  
2. Select USDT and choose the network (TRC20 is cost-effective for large transfers).  
3. Enter the amount (20,000,000 USDT) and the recipientâ€™s wallet address or bank details.  

**Important**: Double-check the recipient address. Blockchain transactions are irreversible.  

### Step 5: Confirm the Transaction

- Email/SMS verification  

After confirmation, the transaction will be processed.
