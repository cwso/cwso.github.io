## Current XRP Market Overview  

### Price and Valuation Metrics  
- **Current XRP Price**: $2.16  
- **Market Cap**: $127.5 billion  
- **Circulating Supply**: 58.88 billion tokens  

XRPâ€™s utility in cross-border payments continues to attract institutional interest, with proponents arguing its undervaluation relative to its adoption potential. Analysts like Cryptominder and BarriC have predicted prices of $50 and $100 within the next five years, though skeptics question the feasibility of such targets.  

## Goldâ€™s Market Cap as a Benchmark  

### Why Compare XRP to Gold?  
Goldâ€™s market cap stands at $23.185 trillion, making it the worldâ€™s largest asset by valuation. If XRP captures **40% of this value**â€”$9.274 trillionâ€”its price would surge dramatically. This comparison highlights XRPâ€™s potential if it transitions from a speculative asset to a global settlement currency.
