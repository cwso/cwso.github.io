# Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Gains OKEx Support, BCH Holders Entitled to 1:1 Token Distribution  

## Understanding the Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork  

The cryptocurrency community is preparing for a significant event as **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)** undergoes a hard fork on November 15, 2025. This technical upgrade has divided the community into two factions—**BCHABC** and **BCHN**—over proposals to fund developer activities through miner taxes. Major exchange **OKEx** has confirmed its support for the fork, ensuring BCH holders will receive new tokens at a 1:1 ratio.  

### Key Details of OKEx's Support  

According to blockchain journalist Colin Wu, OKEx will implement measures to handle the chain split, prioritizing user accessibility and asset security. Here’s what users need to know:  
- On October 28, 2025, OKEx announced it would retain the BCH ticker symbol for the chain with the higher market value post-fork.  
- Tokens from the secondary chain will be airdropped to users’ accounts at a 1:1 ratio based on BCH holdings.  
- The exchange will temporarily suspend BCH deposits and withdrawals during the fork window to prevent network instability.  

> **Why This Matters**: Exchanges like OKEx play a critical role in determining which forked chain gains mainstream adoption. Their support ensures liquidity and trading continuity for users.

## The Chain Split: Developer Funding Debate  

At the heart of the BCH hard fork is a contentious proposal by the **BCHABC development team** to allocate 8% of miner rewards to a fund supporting ongoing protocol development. This **Infrastructure Funding Plan (IFP)** has sparked heated debate within the community:  

### Arguments For the IFP  
- **Sustainable Development**: BCHABC developers argue the funding ensures long-term improvements, similar to Ethereum’s EIP-1559 model.  
- **Professional Management**: Proponents believe dedicated resources will attract top talent to maintain BCH’s competitiveness.  

### Arguments Against the IFP  
- **Centralization Risks**: Critics, including mining pool founder Jiang Zhuoer, warn that mandatory taxes could centralize power among developers.  
- **Market Uncertainty**: Opponents fear the tax may incentivize miners to abandon BCH, destabilizing the network.  

This ideological divide mirrors the 2018 BCH split that birthed **Bitcoin SV (BSV)**. The outcome of this fork will depend on miner participation and market sentiment.

## Impact on BCH Holders: 1:1 Token Distribution  

BCH holders will receive tokens on both chains post-fork, but practical considerations apply:  
1. **Chain Selection**: OKEx will monitor market data to determine which chain retains the BCH ticker symbol.  
2. **Airdrop Mechanics**: Users need not take action—new tokens will automatically appear in their accounts.  
3. **Trading Resumption**: OKEx plans to restart BCH trading within 24–48 hours post-fork, pending network stability.  

### Risks to Be Aware Of  
- **Price Volatility**: Forks often trigger short-term price swings due to speculation.  
- **Wallet Compatibility**: Ensure third-party wallets support both chains to avoid fund loss.

## OKEx’s Operational Status Amid Withdrawal Pauses  

In unrelated developments, OKEx recently faced operational challenges affecting user withdrawals. Key updates include:  
- **Private Key Access**: On October 16, 2025, OKEx temporarily suspended crypto withdrawals after a key team member became unavailable.  
- **Service Restoration**: By October 21, fiat currency trading resumed, followed by crypto withdrawals in stages.

Users are advised to monitor official announcements for final restoration timelines.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### 1. **What is a hard fork?**  
A hard fork is a protocol upgrade that creates two separate blockchain versions. In this case, BCH will split into BCHABC and BCHN.  

### 2. **Will I lose my BCH during the fork?**  
No. Your original BCH remains safe. You’ll receive equivalent tokens on the supported chain, while the secondary chain’s tokens are distributed as airdrops.  

### 3. **How does OKEx decide which chain to support?**  
OKEx evaluates market price, hash rate, and user demand. The chain with higher market value retains the BCH ticker symbol.  

### 4. **Are there risks in holding BCH during the fork?**  
Temporary network congestion or price volatility may occur, but exchanges implement safeguards to minimize risks.  

### 5. **Why did OKEx pause withdrawals recently?**  
The pause was precautionary during a key personnel issue involving private key management. Withdrawals have since resumed.

## The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Cash  

The 2025 BCH hard fork represents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency’s future. If the IFP gains traction, it could establish a new funding model for open-source blockchain projects. Conversely, resistance may lead to further fragmentation.
