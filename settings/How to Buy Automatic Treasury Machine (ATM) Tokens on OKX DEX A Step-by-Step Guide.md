## Step 1: Acquire an OKX Wallet

### Creating Your Web3 Wallet

To begin trading ATM tokens, you'll need a compatible wallet. The **OKX Wallet** offers seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and supports multiple blockchain networks. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the OKX App**  
   Available on iOS and Android, the app provides mobile access to your digital assets.
2. **Set Up or Import Your Wallet**  
   - Create a new wallet: Generate a secure 12-word recovery phrase and store it offline.
   - Import an existing wallet: Use your seed phrase or private key from another Web3 wallet.
3. **Enable Security Features**  
   Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) and biometric login for enhanced protection.

üí° **Pro Tip**: Store your recovery phrase in a physical vault or encrypted digital storage. Avoid sharing it with anyone.

## Step 2: Deposit Funds into Your Wallet

### Preparing Liquidity for Trading

Before purchasing ATM tokens, ensure your wallet holds sufficient funds in a base cryptocurrency like USDT, ETH, or SOL. Here's how:

1. **Select the Correct Blockchain Network**  
   For example, if using Solana (SOL), choose the Solana network to avoid transaction errors.
2. **Transfer Funds**  
   - From your OKX Exchange account: Use the "Withdraw" function to send crypto to your wallet address.
   - From another wallet: Copy your OKX Wallet address and paste it into the recipient field.
3. **Verify Network Compatibility**  
   Confirm that the token and blockchain network match to prevent irreversible loss.

üîç **Key Consideration**: Always double-check the recipient address and network. Mismatched transfers can result in permanent asset loss.
