### 2. Staking AAVE for Passive Income

Current annualized staking yields range between 3-8%, depending on total staked volume.  

**FAQ**:

2. Select the AAVE/ETH or AAVE/stablecoin pool  
3. Deposit equivalent values of both assets  
4. Collect liquidity provider (LP) tokens  
5. Earn trading fees and AAVE rewards
